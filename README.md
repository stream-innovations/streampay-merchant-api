# Developers: StreamPay Merchant API 

To create a StreamPay Web3 Payment API and SDK using the Solana blockchain, you can follow the steps outlined below:

### 1 Set up the development environment:

1.2 Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your machine.

1.3 Create a new directory for your project and initialize it with npm init to set up a new Node.js project.

1.4 Install the required dependencies, such as solana-web3.js, which is the JavaScript library for interacting with the Solana blockchain.

### 2 Design the StreamPay API:

2.1 Determine the specific functionalities you want to include in your API, such as creating invoices, processing payments, and retrieving transaction history.

2.2 Define the API endpoints and the data structures for requests and responses. Consider the parameters required for each endpoint, such as wallet addresses, payment amounts, and transaction IDs.

### 3 Implement the StreamPay API:

3.1 Use the solana-web3.js library to interact with the Solana blockchain. This library provides functions for creating transactions, signing them with private keys, and sending them to the network.

3.2 Implement the API endpoints using a framework like Express.js. Handle the requests, validate the input, and perform the necessary operations using the solana-web3.js functions.

3.4 Integrate authentication and security measures to ensure the API is secure and protected from unauthorized access.

### 4 Test the API:

4.1 Create test cases to validate the functionality of your API. Use testing frameworks like Mocha or Jest to automate the testing process.

4.2 Write unit tests for individual API endpoints and integration tests to ensure the components work together correctly.

4.3 Perform comprehensive testing to handle different scenarios, such as successful transactions, failed transactions, and error handling.

### 5 Develop the StreamPay SDK:

5.1 Create an SDK that provides a simplified interface for developers to interact with your API.

5.2 Wrap the API functionalities into easy-to-use methods, abstracting away the complexity of interacting with the Solana blockchain.

5.3 Provide detailed documentation and examples on how to use the SDK.

### 6 Document the API and SDK:

6.1 Write clear and comprehensive documentation for your API and SDK.

6.2 Include installation instructions, API endpoint details, SDK usage examples, and code snippets.

6.3 Provide guidelines and best practices for developers to integrate the payment functionality into their applications.

### 7 Publish and maintain:

7.1 Publish StreamPay API and SDK to a public repository or package manager, such as npm, to make them easily accessible to developers.

7.2 Maintain the project by addressing bug reports, adding new features, and ensuring compatibility with updated versions of Solana and the solana-web3.js library.

7.3 Remember to refer to the official Solana documentation and the documentation of the solana-web3.js library for detailed information on interacting with the Solana blockchain.

### 8 Design the StreamPay API on the Solana blockchain with web3 integration:

#### 8.1 Create Invoice:

Endpoint: POST /invoices

### 8.2 Parameters:

amount: The payment amount for the invoice.

recipientAddress: The wallet address of the recipient.

Description: Creates a new invoice for a payment.

#### 8.3 Action:

1. Generate a unique invoice ID.

2. Create a Solana transaction using the solana-web3.js library to transfer the specified amount from the sender's wallet to the recipient's wallet.
   
3. Store the invoice details in your database, including the invoice ID, payment amount, sender address, recipient address, and transaction ID.

### 8.4 Get Invoice:

Endpoint: GET /invoices/{invoiceId}

Description: Retrieves the details of a specific invoice.

#### 8.5 Action:

1. Retrieve the invoice details from your database based on the provided invoice ID.

2. Return the invoice details, including the invoice ID, payment amount, sender address, recipient address, and transaction ID.

### 9 Process Web3 Payment:

Endpoint: POST /payments

## 10 Parameters:

invoiceId: The ID of the invoice to be paid.

senderAddress: The wallet address of the sender.

privateKey: The private key associated with the sender's wallet for signing the transaction.

Description: Processes a web3 payment for the specified invoice.

#### 10.1 Action:

1. Retrieve the invoice details from your database based on the provided invoice ID.

2. Validate the sender's wallet address and private key.

3. Create a Solana transaction using the solana-web3.js library, transferring the payment amount from the sender's wallet to the recipient's wallet.

4. Sign the transaction with the provided private key.

5. Broadcast the transaction to the Solana blockchain network.

6. Store the transaction ID and payment details in your database.

### 11 Get Transaction:

Endpoint: GET /transactions/{transactionId}

Description: Retrieves the details of a specific transaction.

#### 11.1 Action:

1. Retrieve the transaction details from your database based on the provided transaction ID.

2. Return the transaction details, including the transaction ID, sender address, recipient address, payment amount, and transaction status.

3. Remember to handle appropriate error responses, authentication, and authorization mechanisms, and implement proper security measures to protect sensitive data. Additionally, consider implementing pagination and filtering options for endpoints that return lists of invoices or transactions.

This is a simplified example to give you an idea of how the StreamPay API on Solana with web3 integration could be designed. You may need to adapt and expand upon this based on your specific requirements and the capabilities of the Solana blockchain and the solana-web3.js library.
